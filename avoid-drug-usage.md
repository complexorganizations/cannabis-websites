# Important Message on Drug Use

## ðŸš¨ **Avoid Drug Use** ðŸš¨

This is a crucial reminder: **Don't do drugs.** The risks associated with drug use are numerous and can have severe consequences on your health, your relationships, and your future. Drugs can alter your personality, impair your judgment, and lead to decisions that you wouldn't make when sober. It's vital to keep yourself safe by avoiding drugs altogether.

## **If You Choose to Use Drugs**

While we strongly discourage drug use, we understand that some may still choose to do so. If you decide to use drugs, it's essential to recognize the risks and take steps to protect yourself:

1. **Understand the Risks:** Drug use can change who you are, leading to shifts in your personality, behavior, and how you interact with others. It can cloud your judgment, making you act impulsively or dangerously.

2. **Think Before You Act:** Under the influence of drugs, you might not think clearly, leading to poor decisions that can endanger your safety and well-being. Always consider the potential consequences before you act.

3. **Know Your Source:** If you still choose to use drugs, ensure they come from a trusted and verified source. Unregulated substances can be laced with harmful additives, increasing the risk of overdose or other serious health issues.

4. **Practice Harm Reduction:** Use strategies to minimize the dangers, such as having a trusted friend present, using in a safe environment, or keeping naloxone nearby in case of an overdose.

5. **Seek Help If Needed:** If you or someone you care about is struggling with substance use, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are resources available to support you in making safer choices.

## **Keep Yourself Safe**

Your safety and well-being should always come first. Avoiding drugs is the best way to protect yourself from the many risks they pose. If you do choose to use, be mindful, be informed, and take every precaution to stay safe.

Take care of yourself and those around you.
